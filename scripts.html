                        benet83: I think so. I don't know why. I don’t know if it’s just because I spent so much time at work, or if it’s just because I don’t know what else I could do.<br>

I'm at a point in my life I honestly think knowing these things is better than not, as in it sort of helps me know how to set goals, accept them, etc.<br>
